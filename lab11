    """Returns: the value of (e ** x) to within the given margin of error.
    
    Do NOT return (math.E ** x).  This function is more exact that that answer.
    
    The value (e ** x) is given by the Power Series
    
        1 + x + (x ** 2)/2 + (x ** 3)/3! + ... + (x ** n)/ n! + ...
    
    We cannot add up infinite values in a program.  So we APPROXIMATE (e ** x)
    by choosing a value n and stopping at that:
    
        1 + x + (x ** 2)/2 + (x ** 3)/3! + ... + (x ** n)/ n!
    
    The error of this approximation is 
    
        abs( (x ** (n+1))/(n+1)!)
    
    which we want less than err.  So to compute e ** x, we just keep computing
    term = (x ** n)/ n! in a loop until this value is less than our error.  If it 
    is not less than the error, we add it to the accumulator, which we return at 
    the end.
    
    Hint: (x**(n+1))/(n+1)!  == (x**n)/n! * x/(n+1)
    Use this fact to simplify your loop.
    
    Precondition: x, err are numbers, err > 0."""
